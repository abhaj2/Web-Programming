<p>When a function is declared as virtual by a base class, it may be overridden by a derived
class. However, the function does not have to be overridden.<br>
 When a derived class fails to override a virtual function, then, when an object of the derived
class accesses that function, the function defined by itâ€™s base class is used.</p>
