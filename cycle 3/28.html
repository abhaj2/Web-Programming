<h1><div>WANoE PPPoE For RoI - TechWiki</div> </h1>
 <p>WANoE solution is implemented for IPoE line types. It works by running the DHCP client
on the bridge interface. DHCP discover is broadcast on all the LAN interfaces. If there is a DHCP offer
on one of the Ethernet interfaces, then that interface will be moved out of the bridge and configured
as a WAN port. Moving it out of the bridge is necessary as we do not want LAN traffic to be bridged
across to the WAN side. Also, since the DHCP client is started on the bridge, if DHCP is allowed to
complete negotiation, then the bridge will acquire WAN IP address and this is not desirable. The
VLAN tagging for the IPoE line is done by the open reach modem.</p>
